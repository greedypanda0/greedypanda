## 🚀 Project Overview

This portfolio follows a **modular and data-driven** approach for scalability and easy maintenance:

### 📦 Assets (Located in `src/app/assets`)

- `**projects.json**` — All my creative projects with links and details  
- `**stack.json**` — Technologies I use, know, or am learning  
- `**themes.json**` — Custom UI themes for aesthetic variety  
- `**journey.json**` — Timeline of my career and learning path  

### 🧠 Custom Hooks (In `src/app/hooks`)

- `usePages.js` — Dynamic page structure and routing  
- `useSocials.js` — Social profiles and contact links  

### 🧩 Components (In `src/app/components`)

- Reusable UI blocks like:
  - `Hero`
  - `Timeline`
  - `StackMarque`
  - `Navbar`, `Typewriter`, etc.

### 📄 Pages

Each section is a standalone page in `src/app`, powered by Next.js routing:

- `/` → Homepage  
- `/projects` → Project showcase  
- `/stack` → My dev toolkit  
- `/journey` → Timeline of growth  
- `/guestbook` → Leave a note or thought
